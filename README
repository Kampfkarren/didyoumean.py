A remake of dcporter's didyoumean.js.

Documentation is the same as his.

You can find the link to didyoumean.js and his repository here: https://github.com/dcporter/didyoumean.js

Use "from didyoumean import didyoumean" to get all the functions

NOTE FROM ONE YEAR LATER: A lot of this code is bad. I have learned a lot about Python in the mean time, but this should still work. If anyone really wants me to fix the ugly parts, feel free to make an issue. Otherwise, it's just going to stay gross.
